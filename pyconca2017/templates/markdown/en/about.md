## What is PyCon Canada?

Our main goal is to strengthen the Canadian Python community by providing more opportunities for us to share knowledge and ideas, encourage support and education for speaking at conferences, and increase the visibility of developers, organizations, and companies within the community.

PyCon Canada is entirely run by volunteers who are passionate about these goals. We hope to see you at the 2016 conference! We're also proud to host development sprints which provide a gateway for new contributors and a way for you to give back to the open-source community.
